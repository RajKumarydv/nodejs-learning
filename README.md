# Topic 1 – What is Node.js?

- Node.js is a runtime that allows JavaScript to run outside the browser.
- Uses Google V8 engine for speed.
- Helps build backend servers, APIs, real-time apps, chat apps, etc.
- JavaScript can now run on server-side, not just inside browser.

## Fun Examples:
- Gamer who can now play anywhere (Node.js gives JS power outside browser)
- Backend tasks like Buy Now button on Amazon handled by Node.js
